# Traffic_Sign_Classification_Keras

Objective- To recognize the traffic sign from the images

- Performed recognition of traffic signals using Deep Learning Techniques
- Developed a ConvNet with 6 Convolutional Layer and 2 Fully Connected Layer
- Used ReLU and softmax for activation
- Used Stochastic Gradient Descent for optimization
- Achieved an accuracy of 99.35% on validation data
- Increased the accuracy to 99.87% by using augmented data
